abstract = {Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) is a recently proposed search method that combines the precision of tree search with the generality of random sampling. It has received considerable interest due to its spectacular success in the difficult problem of computer Go, but has also proved beneficial in a range of other domains. This paper is a survey of the literature to date, intended to provide a snapshot of the state of the art after the first five years of MCTS research. We outline the core algorithm's derivation, impart some structure on the many variations and enhancements that have been proposed, and summarize the results from the key game and nongame domains to which MCTS methods have been applied. A number of open research questions indicate that the field is ripe for future work.},

abstract = {Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithms, including upper confidence Bounds (UCT), have very good results in the most difficult board games, in particular the game of Go. More recently these methods have been successfully introduce in the games of Hex and Havannah. In this paper we will define decisive and anti-decisive moves and show their low computational overhead and high efficiency in MCTS.},
